I used rotating and scaled squares for an assignment in 200c and liked the tunnel effect it created. I wanted to enhance the tunnel effect by animating the scale of the squares. This proved to be quite difficult given that I wanted the animation to loop perfectly but also be able to translate for interaction. Translating after rotating meant the orientation of the translation was changing with the rotation. Using circular displacement made the most sense, and the created a neat curving geometry.

The point of origin for the squares is controlled with the rotary pot and the three buttons change the color of the tunnel. I added a little piece of cardboard under the pot to make it more sturdy. I also covered some of the resistors and wires to hopefully keep everything in place for use by a human.

I would like to add some goal oriented task. First thought was colored squares that you try to "capture" with the rotating tunnel as they fall. You would have to change the color of the funnel to match the square in order to gain points. 

Also, I'm still getting used to using git for versioning and just saving folders on my computer and uploading stuff at the end. I'll get the hang of it eventually.

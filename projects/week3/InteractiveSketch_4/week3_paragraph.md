I used rotating and scaled squares for an assignment in 200c and liked the tunnel effect it created. I wanted to enhance the tunnel effect with animating the scale of the squares. This proved to be quite difficult given that I wanted the animation to loop perfectly but also be able to translate for interaction. Translating before rotating didn't make for an interesting effect. Translating afterwards looked better but meant the orientation of the translation was changing with the rotation.

The point of origin for the squares is controlled with the rotary pot and the three buttons change the color of the tunnel. I added a little piece of cardboard under the pot to make it more sturdy. I also covered some of the resistors and wires to hopefully keep everything in place for use by a human.
